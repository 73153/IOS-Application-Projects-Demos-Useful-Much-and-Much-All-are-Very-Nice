# KGStatusBar

A minimal status bar for iOS. Similair to the status bar seen in the MailBox app. It covers the top status bar and appears like the message is embedded within.

## Installation

* Drag the `KGStatusBar/KGStatusBar` folder into your project.
* Add #include "KGStatusBar.h" to your .pch file

## Usage

KGStatusBar is a singleton. Make sure your view displays the default status bar for this to be effective. I defaulted the colors to match default. Change if needed.

### Showing the Status Bar

* [KGStatusBar showWithStatus:@"Loading"];
* [KGStatusBar showErrorWithStatus:@"Error Synching Files."];
* [KGStatusBar showSuccessWithStatus:@"Successfully synced"];

### Dismissing Status Bar

* [KGStatusBar dismiss];


Enjoy :)
