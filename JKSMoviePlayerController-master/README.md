JKSMoviePlayerController is a little controller for easily adding user-controlled playback of videos to AppKit based applications using the AVFoundation framework. It's inspired, in spirit, by MPMovieController found in the iOS SDK.

How
----

Add the files in JKSMoviePlayerController/* to your Xcode project along with the `AVFoundation`, `QuartzCore` and `CoreMedia` frameworks.

    JKSMoviePlayerController *movieController = [[JKSMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithContentURL:movieURL];
	[self.movieContainerView addSubview:movieController.view];

Where
-----

JKSMoviePlayerController requires Mac OSX 10.8+ Mountain Lion. Primarily because it uses the wonderful +[NSImage imageWithSize:flipped:drawingHandler:]. Adding support for 10.7 should be fairly straightforward though.

Why
----

QTKit and its QTMovieView is the de facto way of adding video playback to Cocoa apps. However it has two major issues on Mountain Lion

1. Its playback controller view doesn't seem to want to play at all together with Auto Layout. `<rdar://12167052>`
2. Its playback controller view looks extremely dull and, well, aged.
3. QTKit feels like one of those frameworks that will eventually be slashed (authors subjective opinion)

Things to do
----

* TODO Hook up the controls in the controller view to the responder chain
* TODO Build it as a `.framework`
