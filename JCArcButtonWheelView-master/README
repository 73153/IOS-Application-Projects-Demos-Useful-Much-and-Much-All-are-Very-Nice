A nice iOS control providing a rotating wheel of buttons, configurable for left or right handed use.

The heart of the wheel is the JCArcButtonWheelView class. Copy and paste JCArcButtonWheelView.h and JCArcButtonWheelView.m 
into your own project. This class does not use arc right now.

The example project shows how to configure for left or right handed use. Can also change on the fly using setLeftHanded method.

Use the ViewController class as an example of how to integrate the wheel into your own projects.

The wheel is set to continue rotation based on the speed of the user's swipe. I recommend experimenting with the constants in
the JCArcButtonWheelView touchesMoved: method. You can adjust the speed by altering the following line:

double approxVel=2*MAX(x2-x1, y2-y1);

It is set to give what I felt is a reasonable spin with little visual jitter. You can also adjust the how fast the rotation slows
after the user stops by adjusting the constants in the JCArcButtonWheelView spinWheel. Make the multiplier in the following line 
smaller to stop the rotation sooner.

self.touchVel*=0.9;
