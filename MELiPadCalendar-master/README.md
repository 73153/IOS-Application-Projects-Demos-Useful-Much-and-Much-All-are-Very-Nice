MELiPadCalendar
=======

Calendar for the iPad with UITableViews to display schedule data, extends [CKCalendar](https://github.com/jaykz52/CKCalendar).
Table rows and font sizes scale dynamically depending on how large you make the calendar.

## Requirements

* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* EventKit.framework
* QuartzCore.framework

## Demo

Build and run the `iPadCalendar` project in Xcode. 
I've included a JSON file and its dependencies in the demo to simulate an API response.

## Installation

Drop the `MELiPadCalendar` folder into your project.
Add `QuartzCore.framework` and `EventKit.framework` if you don't already have them in your project.

## Use

Make sure you declare an instance of `MELiPadCalendarView`, `NSDate`, and `CGRect` as either properties or ivars.

Before initiating the calendar, initiate three arrays, one for the dates which will contain data, another for the todo start times and another for the todo end times.

After that, you can hit your API where you'll populate the three arrays before adding the calendar to some method.

```objc
- (id)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self)
    {
        self.theTodoDates = [[NSMutableArray alloc]init];
        self.theStartHours = [[NSMutableArray alloc]init];
        self.theEndHours = [[NSMutableArray alloc]init];
        
        //hit the API
        [self getTodoTimeStamps];
    }
    return self;
}
```

Initiate the calendar.
The frame and date need to be captured for transitioning between months.

```objc
	calendar = [[MELiPadCalendarView alloc] initWithStartDay:startSunday dates:theTodoDates startTimes:theStartHours endTimes:theEndHours frame:CGRectMake(127,20,770,640)];
    
    calendar.delegate = self;
    frameChosen = calendar.frame;
    orientationDate = [NSDate date];
    [self.view addSubview:calendar];
```

- initWithStartDay can either be startSunday or startMonday and the date range will be Sunday to Saturday or Monday to Sunday respectively.

- dates is an NSMutableArray that stores the dates which have data that needs to be shown.

- startTimes is an NSMutableArray that stores the beginning time for the todo.

- endTimes is an NSMutableArray that stores the end time for the todo.

When a user attempts to move to the previous or next month, the calendar will call `transitionToPreviousMonth` and `transitionToNextMonth` respectively on the delegate.
In these methods, the entire calendar must be removed and reinitiated in order to accomodate larger months such as June, and any new data.

``` objc
- (void)transitionToPreviousMonth
{
    [self.calendar removeFromSuperview];
    
    NSCalendar *calendarForOrientation = [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifier:NSGregorianCalendar];
    NSDateComponents* comps = [[NSDateComponents alloc] init];
    [comps setMonth:-1];
    self.orientationDate = [calendarForOrientation dateByAddingComponents:comps toDate:self.orientationDate options:0];
    
    NSDateFormatter *dateFormatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc]init];
    dateFormatter.dateFormat = @"MM/dd/yyyy";
    
    NSString *stringFromDate = [dateFormatter stringFromDate:self.orientationDate];
    
    calendar = [[MELiPadCalendarView alloc] initWithStartDay:startSunday dates:theTodoDates startTimes:theStartHours endTimes:theEndHours frame:frameChosen];
    
    calendar.delegate = self;
    calendar.selectedDate = [dateFormatter dateFromString:stringFromDate];
    
    [self.view addSubview:calendar];
}
```
##Customizing

- Fonts, text colors, and background colors of nearly every element can be customized.

- For more info, please see [CKCalendar](https://github.com/jaykz52/CKCalendar), the project this one is based on.
