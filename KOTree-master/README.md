KOTree â€“ hierarchy structure component
=======================================

**KOTree** allows you to show a tree of hierarchical data, e.g. files and folders. It was developed for [Kodiak PHP](http://www.becomekodiak.com/), an app which allows you to write and run PHP code directly on the iPad.
