# ADFlipTransition #

An easy to use presentation animation. Transition from one view controller to another. Can be performed modally or as a at a specific frame. Easily add a transition from a cell in a UICollectionViewController or UITableViewController. There are also categories which provide convenience methods for one-line calls, just as you would present any other modal view controller.

Note that modal presentation currently only supports full screen presentation.

## Requirements ##

- Objective-C ARC
- Xcode 4.4 or above
- iOS 5 or above

## Installation ##

Once you have got the source, you can install the component in two ways.

### As a dependency ###

1. Drag the ADFlipTransition.xcodeproj file into your xcode project. *Make sure that it is not open in another window*
2. Click on the project settings and navigate to the target you wish to install for. Click build phases. Add ADFlipTransition to your 'Target Dependencies'.
3. Add the following to 'Link Binary With Libraries': (If not already)
    - libADFlipTransition
	- QuartzCore
4. Go to the 'Build Setting' tab. Add '-ObjC' and '-all_load' to 'Other Linker Flags'
5. Add the repository's file directory to 'User Header Search Paths'


### Import the files ###

1. Drag ADFlipTransition.h & .m and UIView+Snapshot.h & .m into your project, and any of the view controller categories you wish to use.
2. Add QuartzCore to 'Link Binary With Libraries' in your target's 'Build Phases' (If not already)
3. If you're not using ARC, add -f-objc-arc to ADFlipTransition.m's compiler flags. (In 'Build Phases' -> 'Compile Sources')

## Using ADFlipTransition ##

### One Line Presentation ###

```objectivec
#import "UIViewController+ADFlipTransition.h"

@implementation MyViewController 

- (IBAction)showFlippedViewButtonPressed:(UIButton *)sender {
	FlippedViewController *flippedViewController = [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"MainStoryboard" bundle:nil] instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"flippedViewController"];
	[self flipToViewController:flippedViewController fromView:sender withCompletion:NULL];
}

@end
```

Then to dismiss it:

```objectivec
#import UIViewController+ADFlipTransition.h

@implementation FlippedViewController

- (IBAction)backPressed:(UIButton *)sender {
	[self dismissFlipWithCompletion:NULL];
}

@end
```

### From a UICollectionViewController ###

(Or a UITableViewController â€“ just swap '*collection*' for '*table*')

If the index path used refers to a cell which is off-screen, the cell will be scrolled into place (not animated).

```objectivec
#import "UICollectionViewController+ADFlipTransition.h"

@implementation MyCollectionViewController 

- (void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
	FlippedViewController *flippedViewController = [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"MainStoryboard" bundle:nil] instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"flippedViewController"];
	[self flipToViewController:flippedViewController fromItemAtIndexPath:indexPath withCompletion:NULL];
}

@end
```

Dismiss back to a collection/table view controller the same as normal, or you can update the index path if needed.

```objectivec
#import UIViewController+ADFlipTransition.h

@interface FlippedViewController ()

@property (strong, nonatomic) NSInteger pageNumber;

@end

@implementation FlippedViewController

- (IBAction)backPressed:(UIButton *)sender {
	[self dismissFlipToIndexPath:[NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:[self pageNumber] inSection:0] withCompletion:NULL];
}

@end
```
