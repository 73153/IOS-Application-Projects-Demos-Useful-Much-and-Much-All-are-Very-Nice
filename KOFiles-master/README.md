KOFiles â€“ extended table with selection
=======================================

This component is an extended UITableView, suited for showing files and directories. It can display additional information, like date of creation and file size. When an item is selected it shows a toolbox under it. It was developed for [Kodiak PHP](http://www.becomekodiak.com/), an app which allows you to write and run PHP code directly on the iPad.

Features

Individual items can be selected by tapping the icon on the left side of them. Multiple selection is allowed. If you select only one item, a toolbox is shown with an animation.

To see the component in action, take a look at the video at [http://www.becomekodiak.com/](http://www.becomekodiak.com/) or try our app called [Kodiak PHP on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kodiak-php/id542685332?ls=1&mt=8).

We included a demo project that shows how to use the component.
