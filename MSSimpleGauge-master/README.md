MSSimpleGauge are a set of gauge like views that provide customizable visualizations for iOS applications. The initial look and feel of these widgets were inspired by [@mattbango](https://twitter.com/mattbango) sketch on [dribble](http://dribbble.com/shots/424678-Dashboard?list=users).

The gauges are built using Core Graphics and Core Animation and allow for a large amount of customization in code. No additional assets are needed.

See the demo application for some examples on how the to use the gauges.
