		//     either during the initialization with initWithFrame:, or later by directly setting
		//     the frame property.
		//  2. The label is still in phase of initialization
		//
		// If it is the later(2.), then we allow the frame to be set in the usual way(remember this
		// method has overriden the default UILabel setFrame: method) by simply calling setFrame:
		// on super.
		// However once that is done, each subsequent call to setFrame: will not actually set the
		// frame, but will instead only apply a transform to the whole layer/view. This enables
		// animations as one would expect(font size change is animated).
		//
		// Few things to note here: I use BOOL variables to check state here. One would maybe
		// think that it would be enough to check, for example, if current frame is CGRectZero.
		// However when initialization is done with initWithFrame: method, once setFrame: is called
		// the bounds are already set, that is, the size part of the frame is already set. The origin
		// is not. That is so because the frame property is actually a calculated property of position,
		// bounds, anchorPoint and transformation of the underlying layer. The super class implementation
		// of initWithFrame: sets the bounds part. The origin is not zero at that moment, but at negative
		// values of half the size, because center is actually at 0,0.

				// tried to resize it back it would not work because current affine transform is zero.
				// The same goes for current frame sizes that are zero, so multiplying anything with zero
				// would produce zero again. However, bounds property stays the same and is not affected
				// with transformations as the frame property. The reason for this is that frame is,
				// as mentioned in the previous comment, a calculated property. So changing the transform
				// changes the frame, but not bounds. Therefore using bounds here resolves the issue.
