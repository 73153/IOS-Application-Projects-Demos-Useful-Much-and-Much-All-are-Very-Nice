The "non-code", graphics and audio, may not be used, resold, distributed, or copied from your computer to another machine, except to build and run the demo on your own machines.

The artwork is copyrighted by [Allan Simpson](http://www.allansimpson.com). He has created it for a project we are working on. You may not use it for anything except to play with the game engine on your own machine(s). Sorry, it's not mine to let you give out. 

Have fun, because game engines are fun.
