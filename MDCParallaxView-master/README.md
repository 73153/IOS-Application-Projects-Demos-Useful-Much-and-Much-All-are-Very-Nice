## MDCParallaxView

Create a parallax effect using a custom container view,
much like the top view of Path's timeline.

## Sample

Sample usage is available in the `SampleApp`.

## Acknowledgements

The content offset updates are based on those found in
[PXParallaxViewController](https://github.com/tapi/PXParallaxViewController).
While that project uses a custom `UIViewController`, this
one uses a custom `UIView`, which I believe provides a better API.
