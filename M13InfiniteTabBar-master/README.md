M13InfiniteTabBar
=============
M13InfiniteTabBar is an elegant replacement for UITabBar. UITabBar becomes a problem when you have more than five view controllers that have the need to be accessed an equal amount of times. It maskes no sense to hide any of the tabs away under the "More" tab. Plus it takes two extra clicks to reach the view controllers behind the "More" button. M13InfiniteTabBar solves this problem by having all the view controllers on a single level. The "extra" view controllers can be reached by scrolling the tab bar left or right. The scrolling does pose a problem though, in which direction is my offscreen tab? M13InfiniteTabBar solves this by putting the tabs in an infinite scrolling loop. Any tab can be reached by scrolling in any direction. M13InfiniteTabBar also has a few other features that UITabBar doesn't offer on top of that.

Features:
-----------
* Simple to setup; it has a single initialization method, which is passed the UIViewControllers that will be displayed along with their tabs.
* All the colors and icons can be customized to match any application theme. Most properties follow the UIAppearance protocol.
* All the delegate methods work just like the UITabBarControllerDelegate methods. Allowing easy delegate implementation. 
* Handles device rotation in a unique way. The tab bar is sticky to the side of the screen with the home button. When the device is rotated, the view controller and the tab bar icons rotate to the new orientation, the tab bar stays locked in position. Rotation for each view controller is handled separatly. Each view controller can have its own set of allowed orientations; unlike UITabBar, where the view controllers either need to allow all orientations, or use only one orientation.
* Allows user attention to be directed to a specific tab, A tab that requires user attention will change color, and if offscreen the tab bar will show an animation to direct the user's attention to scroll to that tab.

Rotation Handling:
-----------------
M13InfiniteTabBarController handles the rotation of all child view controllers. M13InfiniteTabBarController itself is locked to portrait orientation. It changes the frame, bounds, and angle of the child view controllers manually. It checks the values of the child view controller's "supportedInterfaceOrientations" before rotation. Unlike UITabBarController, rotation for each child UIViewController is handled individually. If one of five child controllers requires portrait orientation while the rest can use any, the other four are not locked to portrait only. Even if the portrait view controller is selected in landscape orientation, it will display in portrait.

Set Up:
--------------
* First create all the view controllers and their tabs.

```
UIViewController *vc1 = [[UIViewController alloc] init];
UIViewController *vc2 = [[UIViewController alloc] init];
UIViewController *vc3 = [[UIViewController alloc] init];
UIViewController *vc4 = [[UIViewController alloc] init];
UIViewController *vc5 = [[UIViewController alloc] init];

M13InfiteTabBarItem *item1 = [[M13InfiniteTabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Title" selectedIconMask:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"] unselectedIconMask:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"]];
M13InfiteTabBarItem *item2 = [[M13InfiniteTabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Title" selectedIconMask:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"] unselectedIconMask:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"]];
M13InfiteTabBarItem *item3 = [[M13InfiniteTabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Title" selectedIconMask:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"] unselectedIconMask:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"]];
M13InfiteTabBarItem *item4 = [[M13InfiniteTabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Title" selectedIconMask:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"] unselectedIconMask:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"]];
M13InfiteTabBarItem *item5 = [[M13InfiniteTabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"Title" selectedIconMask:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"] unselectedIconMask:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"]];
```

* Next create the M13InfiniteTabBarController and set its delegate

```
M13InfiniteTabBarController *viewController = [[M13InfiniteTabBarController alloc] initWithViewControllers:@[vc1, vc2, vc3, vc4, vc5] pairedWithInfiniteTabBarItems:@[item1, item2, item3, item4, item5]];
```

* Customize any of the other attributes of M13InfiniteTabBar after it has been initalized.

* To be able to direct the user's attention, set the requires user attention background view. This feature is separated to allow easy subclassing and custom designs.

```
viewController.requiresAttentionBackgroundView = [[PulsingRequiresAttentionView alloc] init];
```


* Lastly display the controller by adding it to a UIWindow, or pushing it onto a UINavigationController stack.


To Do:
-------------------
These features will eventually be added to M13InfiniteTabBar:

* Adding badges to tab bar items.
* Allow switching the order, adding, and removing of tabs.

Known Issues:
--------------
* Scrolling problems when the tab bar is contained within a UINavigationController.
* The selection triangle not consistantly appearing over the tab bar when the tabs root view are UINavigationControllers.
