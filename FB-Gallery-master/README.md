FB-Gallery
==========
  
This project is an attempt to re-implement the experience of inaction from facebook timeline to photo browser and to figure out how the animations are done. I may not completely implement all features in it. The demo is to illustrate how can be done.  
The photo browser part is developed based on MWPhotoBrowser.  

Update:  
2013-05-19 Add different handling for browsing another image in photo browser  
2013-05-18 Examples with Nib and storyboard  
2013-05-16 Use MWPhotoBrowser as image viewer (Sorry im lazy lol)  

[Video Demo](http://youtu.be/PCU5Loxcj3s)

TODO:  
- Orientation handling
- FB-like Photo description

Happy Coding!
