<h2>Installation</h2>
<hr>
Copy contents of the 'Sources' folder to your project
<h2>Use</h2>
<hr>
The JLActionSheet can be treated just like you would a UIActionSheet.  Initialize it with the title, delegate, cancel title and any other button titles either through the instance initialization or the class helper method.<br><br>Code uses ARC and needs the QuartzCore framework<br><br>

<u>Initialization</u><br>
+sheetWithTitle: delegate: cancelButtonTitle: otherButtonTitles:<br>
-initWithTitle: delegate: cancelButtonTitle: otherButtonTitles:<br><br>

<u>Style</u><br> Set the style of the action sheet through the 'style' property of the JLActionSheet.  Currently support styles are in the JLActionSheetStyle class and are STEEL, SUPERCLEAN, FERRARI and CLEANBLUE<br><br>
<u>Presentation Methods</u><br>
showInView:<br>
showOnViewController:<br>
showFromBarItem: onView:<br>
showFromBarItem: onViewController<br><br>

<u>Block Support</u><br>
Block support is available for JLActionSheet.  You can set two different block variables, clickedButtonBlock and didDismissBlock.  Blocks are given a higher priority since they have to explicitly be set, i.e. when their block gets set it gets called instead of its related delegate method.<br>
setClickedButtonBlock:<br>
setDidDismissBlock:<br>

<u>To Do</u><br>
(1)Â When showing from a barbuttonitem your JLActionSheet needs to be an instance variable<br>
