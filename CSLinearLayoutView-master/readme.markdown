CSLinearLayoutView
=============

`CSLinearLayoutView` is designed to simplify relative layouts on iOS. 

We've all been there beforeâ€” the content in your app is dynamic and you need to display different sized views in neat succession. You spend the next hours pushing pixels, estimating text sizes, and tracking deltas. Lame.

Enter `CSLinearLayoutView`. Create your layout view, create layout items with the views you want to display, and then add the items to your layout. Much simpler.

Example Usage
---------
	// create the linear layout view
	CSLinearLayoutView *linearLayoutView = [[[CSLinearLayoutView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds] autorelease];
    linearLayoutView.orientation = CSLinearLayoutViewOrientationVertical;
    [self.view addSubview:linearLayoutView];
    
    // create a layout item for the view you want to display
    CSLinearLayoutItem *item = [CSLinearLayoutItem layoutItemForView:someView];
    item.padding = CSLinearLayoutMakePadding(5.0, 10.0, 5.0, 10.0);
    item.horizontalAlignment = CSLinearLayoutItemHorizontalAlignmentCenter;
    item.fillMode = CSLinearLayoutItemFillModeNormal;
    
    // add the layout item to the linear layout view
    [linearLayoutView addItem:item];

Checkout the demo project for additional tests and examples.

Setup Instructions
------------------
1. Add `CSLinearLayoutView.h` & `CSLinearLayoutView.m` to your project.
2. If you're using ARC, you'll need to add the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag to `CSLinearLayoutView.m`.
