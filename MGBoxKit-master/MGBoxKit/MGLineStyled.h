/**
* `MGLineStyled` is a very thin wrapper of MGLine, providing default size,
* background colour, padding, and border style. The styling is designed to match
* with and be used with MGTableBoxStyled. It also serves as a basic subclassing
* example (take a look at `MGLineStyled.m` for an example `setup` method).
