Installation
------------

Just drag the class files into your project and make sure to `#import "MxMovingPlaceholderTextField.h"`.

Usage
-----

Either drop a `UITextField` control into your view in Interface Builder and change the class to `MxMovingPlaceholderTextField` in the inspector tab or insert a few lines of code:

    MxMovingPlaceholderTextField *textField = [[MxMovingPlaceholderTextField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0f, 0.0f, 97.0f, 30.0f)];
    textField.placeholder = @"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...";
    [self.view addSubview:textField];
    [textField startMoving];

Apart from that you can also stop the animation:

    [textField stopMoving];

Requirements
------------

`MxMovingPlaceholderTextField` uses ARC and targets iOS 4.0+.
