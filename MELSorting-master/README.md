## Requirements

* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler

## About

See this [tutorial](http://leveton.blogspot.com/2013/08/create-sorting-game-for-ios.html) for an explanation of how I put it together and what I use it for.

Compile this on an iPhone 5 or iPhone 5 simulator.
You will need to tweak the frames in MELSViewController.m for this to look good on an iPhone 4.
