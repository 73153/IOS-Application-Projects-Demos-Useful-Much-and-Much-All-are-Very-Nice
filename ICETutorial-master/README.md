ICETutorial
===========

### Welcome to ICETutorial.
This small project is an implementation of the newly tutorial introduced by the Path 3.X app.
Very simple and efficient tutorial, composed with N full-screen pictures that you can swipe for switching to the next/previous page.

Here are the features :
* Compose your own tutorial with N pictures
* Fixed incrusted title (can be easily replaced by an UIImageView, or just removed)
* Scrolling sub-titles for page, with associated descriptions (change the texts, font, color...)
* Auto-scrolling (enable/disable, loop, setup duration)
* Cross fade between next/previous background
* Easy to use block access to button's events.

### Setting-up the ICETutorial
The code is commented, and I guess, easy to read/understand/modify.
All the available settings for the scrolling are located in the header : ICETutorial.h :

**Texts and pictures :**
```objective-c
    // Init the pages texts, and pictures.
    ICETutorialPage *layer1 = [[ICETutorialPage alloc] initWithSubTitle:@"Picture 1"
                                                            description:@"Champs-Elys√©es by night"
                                                            pictureName:@"tutorial_background_00@2x.jpg"];
    ICETutorialPage *layer2 = [[ICETutorialPage alloc] initWithSubTitle:@"Picture 2"
                                                            description:@"The Eiffel Tower with\n cloudy weather"
                                                            pictureName:@"tutorial_background_01@2x.jpg"];
    [...] 
```

**Common styles for SubTitles and Descriptions :**
```objective-c
    // Set the common style for SubTitles and Description (can be overrided on each page).
    ICETutorialLabelStyle *subStyle = [[ICETutorialLabelStyle alloc] init];
    [subStyle setFont:TUTORIAL_SUB_TITLE_FONT];
    [subStyle setTextColor:TUTORIAL_LABEL_TEXT_COLOR];
    [subStyle setLinesNumber:TUTORIAL_SUB_TITLE_LINES_NUMBER];
    [subStyle setOffset:TUTORIAL_SUB_TITLE_OFFSET];
    
    ICETutorialLabelStyle *descStyle = [[ICETutorialLabelStyle alloc] init];
    [descStyle setFont:TUTORIAL_DESC_FONT];
    [descStyle setTextColor:TUTORIAL_LABEL_TEXT_COLOR];
    [descStyle setLinesNumber:TUTORIAL_DESC_LINES_NUMBER];
    [descStyle setOffset:TUTORIAL_DESC_OFFSET];

    // Load into an array.
    NSArray *tutorialLayers = @[layer1,layer2,layer3,layer4,layer5];
  
```

**Init and load :**
```objective-c
    self.viewController = [[ICETutorialController alloc] initWithNibName:@"ICETutorialController_iPhone"
                                                                  bundle:nil
                                                                andPages:tutorialLayers];

    // Set the common styles, and start scrolling (auto scroll, and looping enabled by default)
    [self.viewController setCommonPageSubTitleStyle:subStyle];
    [self.viewController setCommonPageDescriptionStyle:descStyle];

    // Set button 1 action.
    [self.viewController setButton1Block:^(UIButton *button){
        NSLog(@"Button 1 pressed.");
    }];
    
    // Set button 2 action, stop the scrolling.    
    __unsafe_unretained typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
    [self.viewController setButton2Block:^(UIButton *button){
        NSLog(@"Button 2 pressed.");
        NSLog(@"Auto-scrolling stopped.");
        
        [weakSelf.viewController stopScrolling];
    }];

    // Run it.
    [self.viewController startScrolling];
```

**The title is located in the ICETutorial.m :**
```objective-c
// Setup the Title Label.
- (void)setOverlayTitle{
    // ...or change by an UIImageView if you need it.
    [_overlayTitle setText:@"Welcome"];
}
```
