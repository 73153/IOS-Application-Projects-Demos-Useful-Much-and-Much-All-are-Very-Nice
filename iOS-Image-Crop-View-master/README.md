How to Use
===================
Very easy! It is created to be a drop-in component, so no static library, no extra dependencies.
Just copy <code>ImageCropView.h</code> and <code>ImageCropView.m</code> to your project, and that's it.

The project comes with a working example (as target ***ImageCropView***) to demostrate the usage.
