MLTableAlert
===
**[MLTableAlert][1] is a block-based UIAlertView replacement which allows you to show table view in alerts for fast selection.**  
MLTableAlert is completely based on UIView and it isn't a custom subclass of UIAlertView. It supports ARC and is compatible with iOS SDK 5.0 or later.  
Here are some features:  

* **Block-based**, no more delegates required.
* **table** property to access to the table view.
* **completionBlock** property to configure actions which have to be performed when Cancel button is pressed
* **selectionBlock** property to configure actions which have to be performed when a row in table view is pressed
* Custom height settings
* **Landscape** e orientation support for iPad
* Table alert creation through _class_ or _init_ method
* Table view customization managed by blocks: style your cells as you want
* Beautiful animations
* UIAlertView-like interface
* **Retina ready** and compatible with iPhone, iPod and iPad

This is how the alert looks like:
