MagrackCollectionView
=========

UICollectionView rocks.

IMHO, It was the best addition to iOS 6. Why?

Because implementing grids pre-iOS 6 was a pain.
It caused a lot of hair-pulling and cursing at monitors.

UICollectionView brought the zen back :-).

We have been playing around with it here at App Design Vault.
and decided to implement a Magazine rack for our newest template.


It is called Magrack and I'm sure your apps will look 
even cooler with this.
