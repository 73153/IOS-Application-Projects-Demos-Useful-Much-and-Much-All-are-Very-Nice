## ASDepthModal
ASDepthModal is mostly inspired by a nice CSS work from http://lab.hakim.se/avgrund/.

It gives a sense of depth between the current fullscreen view which is sent backward with a blur effect and a modal popup view which appears in front.

Works on iOS 5 and 6.

The blur effect is a code borrowed from https://github.com/rnystrom/RNBlurModalView.

## Try it
Download the whole project and run it under Xcode. You can choose either iPhone or iPad destination.
It supports all orientations change.

## Use it
Just copy ASDepthModalViewController.h, ASDepthModalViewController.m, UIImage+Blur.h and UIImage+Blur.m in your project and `#import "ASDepthModalViewController.h"` where you need it.

You can also add `pod 'ASDepthModal'` to your Podfile.

### Show
Once you have your popup view, here is how you would present it
``` objective-c
[ASDepthModalViewController presentView:yourPopupView];
```
    
### Hide
The popup view is automatically closed as soon as you tap outside of it.

If you need to close the popup view by code (you usually have a "close" button for this purpose)
``` objective-c
[ASDepthModalViewController dismiss];
```

### Configure
You can configure the background color as well and different kind of options:
* the effect applied on the popup when it appears ans disappears
* whether the underlay view is blurred
* whether a tap outside of the popup closes it.
You can also add some code to execute once the popup is closed.

``` objective-c
[ASDepthModalViewController presentView:yourPopupView
                        backgroundColor:color
                                options:options
                      completionHandler:handler];
```
Three styles are available : no effect, grow effect or shrink effect.
