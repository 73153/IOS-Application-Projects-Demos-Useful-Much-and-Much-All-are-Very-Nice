 Superclass for view controllers that update their UI according to a model object.

 automatically when both the view is loaded and the object is set.

/// @discussion Override in subclasses with a more concrete class and name, i.e.:
///     @property (strong, nonatomic, setter=setObject:, getter=object) UIImage * image;
/// Then make sure that you set the property dynamic:
///     @dynamic image;
@property (strong, nonatomic) id object;

/// Method called when the underlying object sends a NBUObjectUpdatedNotification.
/// @note You should update your object's UI overriding this method.
