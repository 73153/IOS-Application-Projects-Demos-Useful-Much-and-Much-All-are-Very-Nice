 Superclass of most NBUBase views (i.e. ObjectView, ObjectArrayView).
 
 Provides:
 
 - Dynamic resizing.
 - Send SizeThatFitsChangedNotification notifications when its size needs to be adjusted.
 - A noContentsView placeholder shown automatically when the view is empty.
 - Simple tap and swipe recognition with recognizeTap and recognizeSwipe parameters.
