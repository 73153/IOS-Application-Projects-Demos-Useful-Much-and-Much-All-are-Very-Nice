/**
 Abstract UIView that presents a non UI _object_.
 
 Should update its outlets, subviews and state when setObject: is called.
 
 Subclasses should:
 
 - Override the object property (.h file), i.e.:
 
        @property (strong, nonatomic, setter=setObject:, getter=object) UIImage * image;
 
 - Override the setObject setter calling first super (.m file), i.e.:
 
        - (void)setObject:(UIImage *)image
        {
            super.object = image;

            // Configure the view ocording to the object (in this case an image)
            _imageView.image = image;
 
            ...
        }
 
 @note Should be initialized from a Nib file.
